# REPO_INDEX.md

> **Purpose:** Single source of truth for repo state — what files exist, what each is for, current-state pointers (active phase, decision count, master plan version, branch state, active explorations).
>
> Not for: session narratives, change-log entries, decision rationale, doc-by-doc audit trails, multi-paragraph context. Those live in git log, CC_HANDOFF, DECISIONS, or each canonical doc's own scope header.

## Meta

- Last updated: 2026-05-16
- Active phase: Phase 1 — Sinch Proving Ground (per MASTER_PLAN.md); pre-launch checklist gates Phase 1 experiment pickup
- Decision count: 303 active, latest D-388; D-01–D-83 archived. Marketing decisions: latest MD-20.
- Branch state: main; no unmerged feature branches (the five branches merged this session — `feat/blog-scaffold`, `feat/pre-launch-home`, `feat/configurator-pricing-clarity`, `feat/hero-pricing-clarity`, `feat/waitlist-modal` — remain on origin, deletable)
- Active explorations: None

## Active explorations

Sandbox space for product, strategy, and design ideas being prototyped before canonical commitment. See `/explorations/README.md` and `PM_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` "Explorations (sandbox before canon)" for the workflow.

_No active explorations._

## Canonical sources by topic

This index maps each major topic to its single canonical doc. Per the One Source Rule (PM_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md "Docs Hygiene"), every fact lives in exactly one canonical doc; other docs reference it, never restate it. Use this index to decide where a new fact lives, or where to look when surfaces disagree.

### Product
- Pricing facts (numbers, refund policy, tier definitions) → `docs/PRICING_MODEL.md`
- Phases / scope / out-of-scope / North Star → `MASTER_PLAN.md`
- Customer-experience narrative (PM-facing reference) → `docs/PRODUCT_SUMMARY.md`
- Voice / copy principles / kill list → `docs/VOICE_AND_PRODUCT_PRINCIPLES_v2.md`
- Parked ideas / Rejected table → `BACKLOG.md`

### UI / Design
- Screen-level UI specs (every prototype screen) → `PROTOTYPE_SPEC.md`
- Post-signup workspace architecture (state machine, layout systems) → `WORKSPACE_DESIGN_SPEC.md`
- Settings business logic (rejection-behavior model, refund policy, error-code mapping, notification triggers, account-vs-app field split) → `docs/PRD_SETTINGS_v2_3.md`
- Design system tokens + component APIs → `docs/UNTITLED_UI_REFERENCE.md`
- Brand audit (Stage 1 synthesis informing Stage 2 design direction + marketing-site facelift) → `docs/BRAND_AUDIT.md`

### Engineering
- Message pipeline behavior (`/api`) → `MESSAGE_PIPELINE_SPEC.md`
- SDK architecture / publication plan → `SDK_BUILD_PLAN.md`
- `/src` sunset capability map → `SRC_SUNSET.md`
- Carrier registration field knowledge (Sinch/TCR fields) → `docs/CARRIER_BRAND_REGISTRATION_FIELDS.md`
- Sinch experiment findings (recorded request/response shapes, timings, callback payloads) → `experiments/sinch/experiments-log.md`
- OTP/verification feature surface (server endpoint, SDK contract, dashboard panel, onboarding integration) → `docs/VERIFICATION_SPEC.md`
- AI-integration developer-tool research (Phase 8 rationale) → `docs/AI_INTEGRATION_RESEARCH.md` (RETIRES when Phase 8 closes)

### Marketing
- Marketing strategy, plays, decisions (MD-numbered), channels, tools → `docs/MARKETING_STRATEGY.md`
- Deprecated marketing approaches (with deprecation triggers + revisit conditions) → `docs/MARKETING_STRATEGY_ARCHIVE.md`

### Process / governance
- Decision history (active D-84+) → `DECISIONS.md`
- Decision history (archived D-01–D-83) → `DECISIONS_ARCHIVE.md`
- PM standing instructions (synced to Claude.ai UI) → `PM_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- CC standing instructions (operational, on-disk) → `CLAUDE.md`
- Repo doc inventory + active plan pointer → `REPO_INDEX.md` (this file)
- Session-to-session handoff (ephemeral, overwritten each session) → `CC_HANDOFF.md`

### Notes on the README exception
The repo-root `README.md` may paraphrase one-sentence summaries from any of these (e.g., "$49 to register and $19/month thereafter") for orientation, but may not restate full rules. `CLAUDE.md` inherits the same exception for orientation summaries. When in doubt, paraphrase and point.

### When this index drifts
If PM or CC discovers two docs that both claim canonical ownership of the same topic, flag for PM judgment per the One Source Rule. Update this index and the canonical doc together; never silently override.

## marketing-site blog (new — Session 89)

V1 blog scaffold per D-387 (in-repo MDX) and D-388 (cluster-primary taxonomy), built on branch `feat/blog-scaffold` (merged to main Session 90). Files added to the `marketing-site/` app:

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app/blog/page.tsx` | Chronological blog index. |
| `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` | Individual post page (SSG; OG/Twitter/canonical metadata + JSON-LD). |
| `app/blog/cluster/[name]/page.tsx` | Per-cluster index page (11 clusters). |
| `app/blog/feed.xml/route.ts` | RSS 2.0 feed. |
| `app/sitemap.ts` | Sitemap — static routes + blog posts + cluster pages (new file). |
| `app/robots.ts` | robots.txt with sitemap pointer (new file). |
| `lib/blog/types.ts` | Frontmatter + post TypeScript types. |
| `lib/blog/clusters.ts` | Cluster + lane registries — single source of truth for taxonomy. |
| `lib/blog/site.ts` | Site constants (`SITE_URL`, blog title/description/author, OG default). |
| `lib/blog/posts.ts` | MDX loader — reads/parses/validates frontmatter, computes reading time. |
| `lib/blog/format.ts` | Shared date formatter. |
| `lib/blog/mdx-components.tsx` | MDX element → styled component map (hand-rolled prose). |
| `components/blog/*` | `mdx-content`, `prose`, `post-header`, `post-card`, `cluster-badge`, `lane-badge`, `json-ld`. |
| `content/posts/*.mdx` | Blog posts (1 published: `adding-text-messages-to-your-app-shouldnt-take-a-month.mdx`). |
| `public/blog-og-default.png` | Static brand-default OG image. |

Modified: `app/layout.tsx` (added `metadataBase`); `components/footer.tsx` (Blog link, "Resources" column); `package.json` (new deps: `next-mdx-remote` v6, `gray-matter`, `reading-time`, `remark-gfm`, `remark-smartypants`, `rehype-pretty-code`, `shiki`, `feed`); `.env.example` (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`).

## Early-access waitlist (new — Session 90)

Early-access waitlist per MD-20 (DIY on Supabase + Resend over a hosted vendor), built on branch `feat/waitlist-modal` (merged to main). The three "Get early access" CTAs open an in-page modal; signups persist to Supabase and trigger a Resend welcome email. Files added:

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `api/supabase/migrations/007_early_access_subscribers.sql` | `early_access_subscribers` table (applied via Supabase SQL Editor). |
| `marketing-site/app/api/early-access/route.ts` | POST — validate email, idempotent insert, welcome email for new signups. |
| `marketing-site/app/api/unsubscribe/route.ts` | GET — flips `unsubscribed_at` by token; permanent surface (list hygiene). |
| `marketing-site/lib/email/welcome.ts` | Welcome-email template builder (plain-text + HTML). |
| `marketing-site/lib/email/send.ts` | Resend wrapper; never throws. |
| `marketing-site/context/waitlist-context.tsx` | Modal open/close state + configurator-selection summary; provider at layout level. |
| `marketing-site/components/waitlist-modal.tsx` | The waitlist modal (Untitled UI; idle/loading/success/error). |
| `marketing-site/components/early-access-button.tsx` | Client button so server components can open the modal. |

Modified: `app/layout.tsx` (WaitlistProvider + modal mount); `app/page.tsx`, `components/top-nav.tsx`, `components/configurator-section.tsx` (CTAs rewired to the modal; configurator publishes its selection summary up); `package.json` (`resend` dep); `.env.example` (`RESEND_API_KEY`). Pre-launch posture deviations tracked in `docs/PRE_LAUNCH_DEVIATIONS.md`.

- `/experiments` — Phase 1 Sinch proving-ground throwaway code
- `/prototype/archive` — files removed from the active prototype on 2026-05-13 (Session 87 bulk archive); source paths mirrored; see `prototype/archive/README.md` for the un-archive procedure
